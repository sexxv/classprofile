			Fun fact, SE25 started with 147 students, and ended with 117. It&apos;s

	"Average Hourly Co-op Salary vs Gender": (
		<>
			Based on{" "}
			<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/2020/gender-pay-gap/">
				a 2020 industry survey
			</a>
			, the gender pay gap in tech is nonexistent for entry-level positions, but
			gets wider the more senior the job role is. Is the trend the same for
			Waterloo SE students?
			<br />
			<br />
			We found that respondents who identified as women always had a slightly
			higher average hourly co-op salary than those that identified as men. We
			have a small sample size (50 responses from men; 17 from women), so our
			measurements are more susceptible to variance and outliers compared to
			industry averages. So is this a sign of equality and progress, and does
			this trend hold up for full-time offers?
		</>
	),
	"Full-time Total Compensation vs Gender": (
		<>
			Based on our surveys, in contrast to the trend in co-op salaries, women
			had a lower average total compensation than men.
			<br />
			<br />
			However, we had a very small sample (n=37) susceptible to variance,
			outliers, and individual behaviour. After adjusting for outliers, the
			averages are much closer. And again, industry research suggests that
			differences in pay get wider in senior positions, but we don&apos;t have
			data for that.
			<br />
			<br />
			So does the gender pay gap exist, or is it gone? Whatever you conclude, we
			advise you to{" "}

	"Full-time Total Compensation vs Grades": (
		<>
			How much do grades matter for getting a good full-time job? Based on
			research, we&apos;d expect that{" "}
			<a href="https://opus.uleth.ca/server/api/core/bitstreams/1f6aedc6-98d3-4588-a9c8-e0ed5b37d47c/content">
				the effect grades have on earnings in the tech industry
			</a>{" "}
			is higher than the overall average, but{" "}
			<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009102608901800102?casa_token=_9_i7xY5WacAAAAA:4GllEsVqhi40zoozM2xsE_mgYyMXYJCZik5s_0algh-Pw1fgPLpwChHttLhk24pfirQayektX50">
				other studies attribute differences to other majors
			</a>
			, such as business and teaching.
			<br />
			<br />
			There is a slight positive correlation in SE 25 between grades and
			first-year compensation, meaning grades may have a slight positive effect
			on landing a well-paying first job.
			<br />
			<br />
			Does this mean you should panic? Not necessarily. Again, our dataset is
			small and subject to variance and non-response bias (higher earners and
			higher GPAs are more likely to respond). Industry statistics tend to
			suggest the relationship is inconclusive, and there may be hidden
			variables involved. Our advice? Focus on honing your skills (those will
			get you farther) and don&apos;t forget to enjoy your university
			experience.

	"Full-time Total Compensation vs Family Income": (
		<>
			Do the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer? Studies show that{" "}
			parental income is positively correlated with{" "}
			<a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1343324.pdf">
				child achievement in school
			</a>{" "}
			and their{" "}
			<a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/schooled2lose/">
				future socioeconomic status
			</a>
			, but how much does Waterloo&apos;s co-op program help bridge the divide?
			<br />
			<br />
			Turns out, SE 25s from lower-income backgrounds did not necessarily face
			lower first-year compensation overall. This is consistent with the idea
			that Waterloo&apos;s co-op program helps by giving students the
			opportunity to fund their own education. However, as always, take it with
			a grain of salt and do your own research - our data is highly susceptible
			to variance, outliers, and non-response bias. In particular, the highest
			family income bracket had a very low number of responses (there are only
			35 data points represented in this graph), so we&apos;re not sure how
			useful our data is in drawing conclusions there. As always, check out more
			sources!

	"A Note on Full-Time Compensation": (
		<>
			For full-time compensation, respondents gave the currency they would be
			paid in, and we used the same conversion factor for all values (unlike
			co-op compensation, where respondents converted to CAD by themselves). At
			the time of converting, the average USD to CAD rate was 1.43, and the
			average GBP to CAD rate was 1.85
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt</strong> -
			firstly, respondents who had more well-compensated jobs were more likely
			to respond, and secondly this sample size is quite small with only around
			40 responses per question.
			<br />
			<br /> Data displayed on the box plot hover has been rounded to the
			nearest thousand for better readability. The Include/Exclude Outliers
			toggle is relative to the original data.
			<br />
			<br />
			There is a lot of crowdsourced public data on full-time salaries
			available, such as{" "}
			{linkWrapper("on levels.fyi", "https://www.levels.fyi/")} and we invite
			you to look at those, and to contribute when the time comes (this class
			profile is not affiliated with levels.fyi specifically).
