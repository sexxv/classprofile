The interviewer asked me straight up whether I would take the job or not, and I'm pretty sure the fact that I hesitated was the reason why I wasn't ranked.",

I debated for a second and then just decided to be honest and told him \"I don't know\". i told him that I could google it and tell him, but I wouldn't know it otherwise. he started laughing, we had a good laugh about it and then he just ended the interview 15 minutes early.",
